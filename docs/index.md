# Open Source LabVIEW Actions

Unifies LabVIEW CI/CD scripts behind a single PowerShell dispatcher. Use `Invoke-OSAction.ps1` to call actions by name with JSON arguments. The dispatcher exposes discovery commands (`-ListActions` and `-Describe`) and preserves each action's exit codes. It runs on Windows or Linux runners with LabVIEW and g-cli available, and supports `-DryRun` for safe previews.
