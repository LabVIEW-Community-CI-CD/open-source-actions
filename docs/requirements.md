# Requirements

This project tracks high‑level requirements and maps each one to the Pester test files that verify it. The authoritative mapping is stored in [`requirements.json`](../requirements.json); the table below provides a human‑readable summary for quick reference.

Each test file is annotated with its corresponding requirement ID to maintain traceability between requirements and test coverage.

During CI runs, `scripts/generate-ci-summary.ts` writes requirement artifacts to an OS‑specific directory under `artifacts/`, such as `artifacts/windows/traceability.md` or `artifacts/linux/traceability.md`, using the `RUNNER_OS` environment variable.

Each directory also includes a `summary.md` file with per‑OS totals. A typical summary might look like this:

| OS | Passed | Failed | Skipped | Duration (s) | Pass Rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| overall | 10 | 0 | 2 | 12.34 | 100.00 |
| windows | 5 | 0 | 1 | 6.17 | 100.00 |
| linux | 5 | 0 | 1 | 6.17 | 100.00 |
